# clEsperanto

clEsperanto is about the idea of removing language barriers in the image analysis community. 
What if image analysists working with [Fiji], [Icy], [ImageJ], [Matlab], [Python] and others would write their workflows with the same commands?
Furthermore, we live in the age of [GPU-acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit). 
Many algorithms will be re-implemented in the coming years for GPUs. Let's make them available 
* on all major hardware platforms, 
* on all major operating systems,
* in all major programming languages and environments.

This screenshot collage is not a dream. You can download plugins for these platforms and reproduce it:
* [Fiji](https://clij.github.io/)
* [Icy](https://clij.github.io/clicy/)
* [ImageJ1](https://github.com/clij/clij-legacy/)
* [Matlab](https://clij.github.io/clatlab/)
* [Python](https://clij.github.io/clijpy/)

Here you find the [reference](https://clij.github.io/clij-advanced-filters/reference) of currently implemented commands.
